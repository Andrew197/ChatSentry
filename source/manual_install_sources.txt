mIRC 6:
all of the files in this sources directory
MUST be placed in c:/program files/mirc/addons.

newer versions:
all of the files in this sources directory
MUST be placed your application data / mirc / addons directory. If the 'addons' folder does not exist, create it and copy all of the files there.

I will publish a better install process when I can.
