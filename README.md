<b>ChatSentry</b> is my second extension to the popular Windows internet relay chat (IRC) application mIRC. Like Colorlock, it was also designed to add a feature to the program that was oddly missing - customizable notifications. In a nutshell, this program allows you to setup audible and visible alerts for many events in a chatroom, most notably when friends enter and exit a room you're on. This can consist of beeps, window flashes, or custom sound files that you specify. Each event is individually configurable.<br><br>

Chatsentry also features 'word alerts', which allow the user to specify a notification if someone says a trigger word in the room, such as the user's name or topics they're interested in. This feature recieved much fanfare from the very active 100+ user rooms on Webchat, that often scroll too quickly for much meaningful conversation to occur otherwise. It's also handy if someone needs to get your attention while distracted with other work.<br><br>

This has been tested on mIRC 6.x. Newer versions should work fine, but may require different placement of the folders or a manual install from the sources directory to your application data folder. I'll try to figure out a better install process for newer versions when I have time to.
